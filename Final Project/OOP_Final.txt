After the tragic loss of a Mr. Anthony Stark in Avengers: Endgame my soul has been left empty, my mind decrepit, like a large object with a small brain. 
Specifically, Dr. Stark’s personal AI assistant, Jarvis, is the focal point of my loss. My group figured that we commemorate the tragic loss of Anthony Stark 
and that we also commemorate a most legendary Procedural and Object-Oriented Programming instructor by recreating a Python-based AI assistant for 
Windows and Mac OS based on Dr. John Morrison. The AI bot will do a variety of tasks, from welcoming the user to having engaging conversations with 
the user drawing upon all of Dr. Morrison’s legendary catch phrases.
