    <h2>Lab 2: Boolean</h2>

<p><strong>Introduction: Claim of order</strong>
    When testing for the boolean order of operations in python, I went through several iterations of code
before finally finding the lines which backed my claims. When I finished, I found the operations to be
</p>
<pre class="pybox">
&gt;&gt;&gt; First
&gt;&gt;&gt; "not" statements
&gt;&gt;&gt; "and" statements
&gt;&gt;&gt; "or" statements
&gt;&gt;&gt; Last
</pre>

<p><strong>Evidence: "and" takes precedence over "or"</strong>
    When examining the code below, it can be seen that the lines are almost identical, besides a group of
parenthesis, but have opposite outputs. This is because in the first line, python carries out its order
of operations without interupption, carrying out the "and" statement, which checks if both objects are True,
and returns "True" if they are, and "False" if they are not. Because both objects are not "True", this
statement returns "False" and moves on to the "or" statement, taking the result of the "and" statement and 
comparing it to "True". This statement returns "True", as "or: statements check if one of the objects on either 
side of it are "True", and returns "True" if there is. Because all the computations have been completed, the 
terminal returns the final result, that being "True".
    In the second line, the parenthesis around the "or" statement break the order of operations and force 
it to compute first. That statement returns "True", which is then used in the "and" statement. Using the
same logic as described above, the result of the "and" is False, which leaves all the computations complete,
and "False" as the final result to be returned.
</p>
<pre class="pybox">
&gt;&gt;&gt;True or True and False
True
&gt;&gt;&gt;(True or True) and False
False
</pre>
<p><strong>Evidence: "not" takes precedence over "or"</strong>
    Looking at the two statements, it can be seen that, similarly to the previous section, the lines 
are almost identical besides a pair of parenthesis. This is because, in the first line, order of operations
runs its course, the "not" statement turning a "True" object to "False" and then evaluates the "or" statement.
Because at least one object is "True", the statement returns "True", which is the final result.
    The second line again breaks the order of operations, forcing the "or" statement to evaluate first. The 
result is "True" which is then flipped to its opposite by the "not" statement, leaving the final result "False".
</p>
<pre class="pybox">
&gt;&gt;&gt;not True or True 
True
&gt;&gt;&gt;not (True or True)
False
</pre>
<p><strong>Evidence: "not" takes precedence over "and"</strong>
    Finding the evidence for this claim took a lot of trial and error, but the code below proves that "not"
statemnets take precedence over "and" statements.
    This one line of code seems rather inconspicuious at first glance, but truely does prove "not" statements'
precedence. If we were to evaluate the expression assuming that "and" statements follow first, we would need
to start on the right. "True" and "True" are both "True" statements, returning the result "True". Now, this 
theory becomes problematic, as there is no way to compute "True and not True" without being impeeded by a 
"not" statement in the center, therefore, it should produce an error. 
    Because there is no error, this suggests that not was not evaluated last, but first, clearing the statement
of any impediments.
