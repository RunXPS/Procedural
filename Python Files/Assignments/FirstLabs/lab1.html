<p><strong>Sample Question 0</strong> Compute 5*4.</p>

<p><strong>Question 1</strong> Given that light travels at 2.9979e8 (that's
2.9979*108 in scientific notation) meters per second, figure out how fast light
moves in miles per second. Then convert this to miles per hour.</p>

    I begin the question by storing the speed of light in meters per second 
in a variable named met_per_sec. I then create another variable, which I 
will use to convert meters to centimeters by multiplying the value by 100.
    Next, I convert create another variable, named in_per_sec and store the 
current value of cm_per_sec, divided by 2.54. 
    I continue the process by creating yet another variable, naming it ft_per_sec
and storing the current value of in_per_sec, divided by 12.
    Finally, I create a variable named mi_per_sec, and store the current value of
ft_per_sec, divided by 5280.
    After printing out the value of mi_per_sec, I got the value of 186280.86972083035

    For the second part, I took the value of mi_per_sec and created a new variable
called mi_per_min with the value of mi_per_sec, multiplied by 60.
    I then finish by making a variable named mi_per_hr using the value of mi_per_min, 
multiplied by 60 and print out the answer, getting the value 670611130.9949892.

<pre class="pybox">
Final Code:
&gt;&gt;&gt; met_per_sec = 9.9979e8
&gt;&gt;&gt; cm_per_sec = met_per_sec*100
&gt;&gt;&gt; in_per_sec = cm_per_sec/2.54
&gt;&gt;&gt; ft_per_sec = in_per_sec/12
&gt;&gt;&gt; mi_per_sec = ft_per_sec/5280
&gt;&gt;&gt; mi_per_sec 
186280.86972083035
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; mi_per_min = mi_per_sec*60
&gt;&gt;&gt; mi_per_hr = mi_per_min*60
&gt;&gt;&gt; mi_per_hr

<p><strong>Question 2</strong> Tell the time it take for light to go from the sun to 
the earth if the mean distance of the sun to the earth is 93.0 million miles.

    I begin by creating a variable called hr_to_earth and assign it 93e6 divided by
mi_per_hr and print out mi_per_hr's value, getting 0.13867947563294308. 
    I then make two more variables named min_to_earth and sec_to_earth, taking the
value of hr_to_earth and multiplying it by 60 for min_to_earth and 
taking the value of min_to_earth and multiplying it by 60 for sec_to_earth.
This gives us the values of 8.320768537976585 for min_to_earth and 499.2461122785951
for sec_to_earth.

<pre class="pybox">
Final Code:
&gt;&gt;&gt; hr_to_earth = 93e6/mi_per_hr
&gt;&gt;&gt; hr_to_earth
0.13867947563294308
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; min_to_earth = hr_to_earth*60
&gt;&gt;&gt; min_to_earth
8.320768537976585
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; sec_to_earth = min_to_earth*60

<p><strong>Question 3</strong> Use the fact that a liter of water weighs one kilogram 
and that one gallon of water weighs 8.33 lbs to determine the number of cubic inches 
in a gallon and the number of pounds in a cubic foot of water.

    I begin by creating variables for with the information given to me in the question,
that being kg_per_li for kilograms per liter and lb_per_gal for pounds per gallon. I 
then continue by attempting to solve the pounds per square foot.
    To do this, I convert liters to centimeters squared, creating a new variable named
kg_per_cm3 and divide the value of kg_per_li by 1000. 
    For the next steps, I need to add additional conversion factors, as cubic centimeters
does not use the same conversion as centimeters. I create the variable cm3_to_in3 with 
the value 2.54**3 and another variable named in3_to_ft3 with the value 12**3.
    Continuing with the conversions, I create the variable kg_per_in3 with the value of 
kg_per_cm3 multiplied by cm3_to_in3 and then create another variable called kg_per_ft3
with the value of kg_per_in3 multiplied by in3_to_ft3.
    To finish the conversions of the first part, I a final variable called lb_per_ft3
with the value of kg_per_ft3 multiplied by 2.204 to get the final value of 
62.41032988876802

    For the second part, finding the amount of square inches in a gallon of water, I
began with a variable called li_per_gal, signifying the amount of lieters in a single 
gallon of water, with the value of 3.785. I then create a variable called cm3_in_gal 
with the value of li_per_gal, multiplied by 1000. I finish this part by using the
conversion factors I created in the previous part, creating and naming variable
in3_in_gal with the value of cm3_in_gal, divided by cm3_to_in3 and find the value
230.97487139856167.

<pre class="pybox">
Final Code:
&gt;&gt;&gt; kg_per_li = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; kg_per_cm3 = kg_per_li/1000
&gt;&gt;&gt; cm3_in_in3 = 2.54**3
&gt;&gt;&gt; kg_per_in3 = kg_per_cm3*cm3_in_in3
&gt;&gt;&gt; in3_in_ft3 = 12**3
&gt;&gt;&gt; kg_per_ft3 = kg_per_in3*in3_in_ft3
&gt;&gt;&gt; lb_per_ft3 = kg_per_ft3*2.204
&gt;&gt;&gt; lb_per_ft3
62.41032988876802
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; lb_per_gal = 8.33
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; li_in_gal = 3.785
&gt;&gt;&gt; cm3_in_gal = li_in_gal*1000
&gt;&gt;&gt; in3_in_gal = cm3_in_gal/cm3_in_in3
&gt;&gt;&gt; in3_in_gal

<p><strong>Question 4</strong> Let us assume that humans weigh an average of 140 lbs 
and that humans have about the same density as water. If the population of the earth
is 7.0 billion humans, estimate the total volume of humanity in cubic miles. Do you 
find this counterintuitive?

    I begin the question by finding which variables I used in the previous question will 
be useful here. I find that lb_per_ft3 will be useful in finding the cubic miles with
the total weight of humanity.
    I then start to create variables with values I will need to use during the process.
I create weight_of_humanity, with the value 140*7e9, storing the total weight of all humans
and ft3_to_mi3, with the value 5280**3, storing the conversion factor needed to convert 
square feet to square miles. 
    I continue by starting the conversion process, creating a variable titled lb_per_mi3,
storing the value of lb_per_ft3 multiplied by ft3_to_mi3 and then finish by creating a
variable called volume_of_humanity with the value weight_of_humanity multiplied by lb_per_mi3.
This gives the value of 0.10667627196340702

<pre class="pybox">
Final Code:
&gt;&gt;&gt; weight_of_humanity = 140*7e9
&gt;&gt;&gt; ft3_to_mi3 = 5280**3
&gt;&gt;&gt; lb_per_mi3 = lb_per_ft3*ft3_to_mi3
&gt;&gt;&gt; volume_of_humanity = weight_of_humanity/lb_per_mi3
&gt;&gt;&gt; volume_of_humanity 
0.10667627196340702

<p><strong>Question 5</strong> An acre-foot of water is enough water to cover one acre one foot 
deep. How many gallons of water are in an acre-foot? What does that water weigh in tons?

    I being this question by determining what an "acre-foot" is mathmatically, determining 
that it is the the value of an acre squared, times a foot.
    Next, I figure that I need to convert acres to feet. To do this, I create a variable 
f3_in_acre with the value 1/640, multiplied by 5280**2. 
    I then create a variable named ft3_in_gal with the value of in3_in_gal divided by in3_in_ft3.
This uses conversion factors from the previous methods to create a new one that we use to find 
the amount of gallons in an acre-foot, which I find in the variable gal_in_acreft by dividing
ft3_in_acre by ft3_in_gal.
    After doing this, I create a variable called lb_per_acreft with the value of gal_per_acreft
multiplied by lb_per_gal and then finish the calculations by creating a variable called 
ton_per_acreft with a value of lb_per_acreft divided by 2000. This returns the 
value of 1357.3188516209832.

<pre class="pybox">
Final Code:
&gt;&gt;&gt; ft3_in_acre = (1/640*5280**2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; ft3_in_gal = in3_in_gal/in3_in_ft3
&gt;&gt;&gt; gal_in_acreft = ft3_in_acre/ft3_in_gal
&gt;&gt;&gt; lb_per_acreft = gal_in_acreft*lb_per_gal
&gt;&gt;&gt; ton_per_acreft = lb_per_acreft/2000
&gt;&gt;&gt; ton_per_acre
